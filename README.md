This project is based on my project for CS 109 "Rational Social Learning (RSL): An Interactive Simulation of Rational Social Learning" which investigates how individuals update their beliefs and make decisions based on both private information and the actions of others. This study presents an interactive simulation that demonstrates two models within RSL: the Step-by-Step Simulation, where each individual's belief is updated using all prior actions, and the Random Sampling Simulation, where individuals update their beliefs using only a subset of previous actions. These models reflect different real-world scenarios and provide insight into the dynamics of group decision-making and belief evolution. The project explores key concepts such as Bayesian inference, private signals, and belief updating, and discusses their implications for domains such as finance, social media, public health, and organizational decision-making.
